				Envision is a virtual accelerator for women and people of color who are currently in college, with the goal of diversifying the entrepreneurship and venture world by providing hands-on workshops, resources, mentorship, and individualized support for those who are currently working on a company. </br></br>

				Only 3% of venture funding goes to women, and less than 1% to people of color. It's time to change that dynamic. By starting entrepreneurship education early and democratizing opportunity and access to capital, we can equalize the playing field and amplify those that are sometimes overlooked. </br></br>

				Envision will accept 15 incredible ventures for its pilot program that will run from July 6th - August 30th, and will feature hands-on workshops for founders tailored to their specific needs (anything from pricing strategies to hiring to raising capital), mentorship from top tier founders/operators/investors, and access to funding opportunities.</br></br>

				We have partnered with top-tier VC funds and entrepreneurs on this endeavor to provide sponsorships, workshops/office hours, and access to mentors. Our goal is to get as many of these startups funded by the end of the program as possible, and weâ€™re deeply committed to their success. </br></br>

				Reach out if you'd like to get involved! </br>
